## How to install?
Download and upload all the files on your web hosting. Then all you need to edit is in the **config.php** file.
### Customize Title
In `title` you just need to replace `MOFH-Material-Template` with your company's name.
### Customize Logo
In `logo` just replace `https://domain.tld/img/logo.png` with the URL of your company's logo or replace the picture there with your logo.
### Change the protocol used
In `protocol` all you need to do is to change the protocol of the site to `http` or `https`, based on which one you want to use. The default setting is `https`, if you are not using SSL change it to `http`.
### Customize Favicon
In `favicon` just replace `/img/favicon.ico` with the URL of your company's logo which you want to show as favicon.
### Change Affiliate ID
In `affid` just replace `25705` with your iFastNet affiliate id.
### Customize Social Media
In `facebook`, `twitter`, `google-plus` and `linkedin` replace `https://www.facebook.com/#`, `https://twitter.com/#`, `https://plus.google.com/#` and `https://www.linkedin.com/in/#` respectively with your social profile links.
### Change the domain
You don't need to customize anything here, as the script we have provided will automatically detect the URL of your site. If the script does not work for some reason though, just change it to your domain's address.
